     		 <h2>Property tax in Greece</h2>
      		<h5
          The property tax is payable based on the “basic tax”, which depends on the objective value of the property.
          
          </h5>
     		<!-- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>-->
      <p>
   The annual real estate holding tax includes both the basic property tax and the supplementary tax. The basic property tax is applicable to buildings, land lots, agricultural land etc. The basic tax is then multiplied by several other factors, including but not limited to the location of the property, age of the property, the floor level and the number of facades of the property.

     		 <h2>Unemployment in Europe in 2015-2020</h2>
     		 <h5>
        One of the key problems in the EU is unemployment. Regardless of the economic growth that has been detected during the most part of 2017-2018, the unemployment problem remains a rather major issue. 
         </h5>
     <!-- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>-->
      <p>
     Greece is a country that is more than others affected by the unemployment problem.

In 2015 the local crisis led to 25% of the working-age-population (or every fourth) ended up in unemployment.

However, the openness of the Greek market helped improve the situation to a certain extent. During the last five years the unemployment rate decreased by over 6%. The forecast in view of the pandemic is negative, as in the rest of the EU: due to COVID-19 the unemployment rate might again go up to 21%.

Even though Greece’s unemployment rates are the highest in the European Union, still, during the last five years unemployment was steadily decreasing, which gives hopes for the strengthening of the market.

      <h2>Subsidies or State-aid? What will save the EU’s economy from the COVID-19 impact?</h2>
      <h5>We are witnessing Europe relax restrictions, that were previously imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, although with caution and in phases.  </h5>
     <!-- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>-->
      <p>
Governments across Europe have stated, that the unprecedented support packages, backed by public funds, will be in force and constantly supplemented to help the business. For many enterprises quantifying the COVID-19 impacts will be delayed by a few months due to the accessibility of short-term government-backed financing, as well as due to other measures of available state help schemes against the economic shock, caused by COVID-19.

      <h2>Most popular European capitals: real estate prices</h2>
      <h5>When one thinks of luxury, first of all, the images of Paris, London, or Milano come to mind – the cradles of fashion and international trends.  </h5>
     <!-- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>-->
      <p>

      <h2>Northern suburbs of Attica – choice of the upper class</h2>
      <h5>If you start moving north of downtown Athens, in just 30 minutes you will get to the Kifisia suburb. </h5>
     <!-- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>-->
      <p>
Kifisia is literally swimming in greens, the air is incredibly fresh, even smells like mountain air. Thus, any house for sale you can find in Kifisia can already be considered a private resort, where one can get healed by nature. Not only the local wealthy people are looking to buying here their dream house, but also, foreigners, who can clearly see all the attractive opportunities of Greece.
