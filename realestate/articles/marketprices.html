     		 <h2>Stock vs real estate in the world from 2015 through 2020</h2>
      		<h5
          Throughout the biggest part of the history of the US, at least the part that we can deem to have reliable information about, the real estate prices have increased not more than to the level of general development of inflation
          
          </h5>

      <p>
  Each investment into property gives one full control over the situation. The owner is able to make improvements, cut expenses (e.g. decide on mortgage refinancing now, when the rates came down again to a record low), increase the rent, find better tenants or sell the property. The mortgage rates nowadays are record low.

     		 <h2>US Dollar vs Euro ? 2011 – 2020</h2>
     		 <h5>
         EUR/USD is the most commonly traded currency pair by volume. The two currencies are in constant competition, and the main question that is on the table is which one of them is better and more secure.
         </h5>
     <!-- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>-->
      <p>
       The Euro is a rather young currency, that was introduced as an accounting currency in 1999, but physically was entered into circulation in 2002. That was the moment when the US Dollar, for the first time in its history, was shaken in its position as the world’s reserve currency, yet as of today made it to stay in this position.

      <h2>How have large funds been handling European stocks since 2011?</h2>
      <h5>Despite substantial benefit for equity capital, compared to risk-free assets, many major funds do not invest into European stock.</h5>
     <!-- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>-->
      <p>
   
Irrespective of the popular opinion European countries do not have a large number of innovative solutions and rapidly growing companies. As a comparison, South Korea can offer much more stable profit of a bigger scale. European conservatism sometimes plays cruel jokes on stocks and forces them to remain on a stable margin for a long time. Even though it is not by itself a bad thing, such stocks are usually unable to produce profit.

France opened its borders for EU nationals. Third-country nationals, including those from Russia, may enter the country starting from July. Citizens of any country, holding a residence permit, may apply for permanent residency in 5 years.
